 Implemented Kruskal's algorithm to compute the minimum spanning tree and maximum savings in network optimization a classic graph theory problem that demonstrates how efficient algorithms can minimize costs in infrastructure networks, such as telecommunications or transportation systems in resource-constrained settings
 To run the code , you may download it as a file or clone the repo and then run it in a code editor **(VS code better)** or you may copy the code and run it in an online python compiler.
_**NOTE**_ : Running the code in VS code make sure that you have the python extensions installed.
